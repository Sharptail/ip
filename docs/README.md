**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo Borrow Book`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `deadline DESCRIPTION /at DATE [TIME]` can be used as 
  `deadline Return Book /at 2021-09-27 15:00` or as 
  `deadline Return Book /at 2021-09-27`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple time.<br>
  e.g. `delete …​` can be used as `delete 1 2 3` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters 
  (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
